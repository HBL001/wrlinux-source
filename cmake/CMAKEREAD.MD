# Key Points:

    CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME: Specifies the target operating system.
    CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR: Indicates the target architecture.
    CMAKE_C_COMPILER and CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER: Set the cross-compilation compilers provided by your Wind River SDK.
    CMAKE_SYSROOT: Points to the root filesystem for the target environment.
    CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH and related settings: Ensure that CMake searches for headers and libraries in the target sysroot.

## Usage:

When configuring your CMake project for cross-compilation, specify this toolchain file:

cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/wrlinux_toolchain.cmake /path/to/your/source

Replace path/to/wrlinux_toolchain.cmake with the actual path to your toolchain file and /path/to/your/source with the path to your project's source code.

By setting up this toolchain file appropriately, CMake will utilize the correct compilers and paths for cross-compiling your project using the Wind River Linux SDK.
